						institution and for compiling reports and awards. E-Learning Learning may also collect and store an e-mail address provided by users of 
						accounts created by parents and educational institutions for the purpose of password reset. E-Learning Learning will not ask children under 
						age 13 for more information, as a condition of participation, than is reasonably necessary to participate in a given activity. 
						Any disclosure of information collected from children under the age of 13 to third parties will be pursuant to an agreement of
