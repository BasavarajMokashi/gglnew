                             <h3>TERMS OF SERVICE</h3><br>
						<h5 style="color:#003175">1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h5>
						E-Learning Learning, Inc. (hereafter called "E-Learning") provides its service to you, subject to the following Terms of Service ("TOS"), which may be updated by us from time to time without notice to you. When using particular E-Learning services, you and E-Learning shall be subject to any posted guidelines or rules applicable to such services which may be posted from time to time. All such guidelines or rules are hereby incorporated by reference into the TOS.
                         <br><br>
						<h5 style="color:#003175">2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</h5>
                           
						E-Learning currently provides users with a service to help learn and practice mathematics, language arts, science, and social studies. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new E-Learning properties, shall be subject to the TOS. You understand and agree that the Service is provided "as-is" and that E-Learning assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, misdelivery or failure to store any user communications or personalization settings.
                         
						In order to use the Service, you must obtain access to the Internet, either directly or through devices that access web-based content, and pay any service fees associated with such access. In addition, you must provide all equipment necessary to make such connection to the Internet, including a computer and modem or other access device.
                         <br> <br>
						<h5 style="color:#003175">3. YOUR REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS</h5>

						In consideration of your use of the Service, you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service's registration form (such information being the "Registration Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or E-Learning has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, E-Learning has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service (or any portion thereof).  
                       <br> <br>
					   <h5 style="color:#003175">4. MEMBERSHIP AND BILLING</h5><br>

						Family Memberships<br><br>

						You can find the specific details regarding your membership with E-Learning at any time. Simply sign in to your E-Learning parent account, go to the Membership tab, and click Manage your account.
                             <br><br>
						a. Billing<br><br>

						By starting your E-Learning membership, you are expressly agreeing that we are authorized to charge you the membership fee associated with the type of membership (monthly or yearly) you chose during registration. You agree that we are authorized to charge you the membership fee at the then-current rate to the Payment Method you provided during registration (or to a different Payment Method if you change your account information). Please note that prices and charges are subject to change with notice. As used in these Terms of Service, "billing" shall indicate either a charge or debit, as applicable, against your Payment Method. The membership fee will be billed at the beginning of the paying portion of your membership and each month or year thereafter unless and until you cancel your membership. Sign in to your E-Learning parent account, go to the Membership tab, and click Manage your account to see the commencement date for your next renewal period. We automatically bill your Payment Method each month or year on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paying membership. Membership charges are fully earned upon payment.

						Note: In the event your monthly membership began on a day not contained in a given month, we bill your Payment Method on the last day of such month. For example, if you became a paying member on January 31, your Payment Method would next be billed on February 28.

						You acknowledge that the amount billed each billing period may vary for reasons that include differing amounts due to changes in your membership plan, and you authorize us to charge your Payment Method for such varying amounts. Payments are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods. We may change the fees and charges in effect, or add new fees and charges from time to time, but we will give you advance notice of these changes by e-mail. If you want to use a different Payment Method or if there is a change in Payment Method, such as your credit card validity or expiration date, you may edit your Payment Method information from your Account management page. To access your Account management page sign in to your E-Learning parent account, go to the Membership tab, and click Manage your account. If your Payment Method reaches its expiration date and you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel your account (see, "Cancellation" below), you authorize us to continue billing that Payment Method and you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts.
                         <br><br>
						b. Ongoing Membership<br><br>

						Your E-Learning membership will continue in effect unless and until you cancel your membership or we terminate it. You must cancel your membership before it renews each billing period in order to avoid billing of the next membership fee to your Payment Method. We will bill the membership fee at the then-current rate plus any applicable tax to the Payment Method you provide to us during registration (or to a different Payment Method if you change your account information). Membership fees are fully earned upon payment.
                        <br><br>
						c. Cancellation<br><br>

						You may cancel your E-Learning membership at any time, and cancellation will be effective immediately. You will continue to have access to the program until the current billing period ends. We do not provide refunds or credits for any partially used membership periods. To cancel your membership, sign in to your parent account and click the words "Cancel membership" on your Account management page. Follow the instructions for cancellation under the heading "Cancel Membership."
                         <br><br>
						d. Purchases through the Apple iTunes store<br><br>

						If you purchased your E-Learning membership through your iTunes account, sections 4a through 4c of "Membership and Billing" may not apply to you. Because such a purchase is between you and the Apple iTunes store, and not E-Learning, you acknowledge and agree that E-Learning is not responsible for billing for your membership and is not responsible or liable for any claims relating to your purchase. If you have questions about membership or billing, you should contact the Apple iTunes store directly.
								<br><br>			   
					   <h5 style="color:#003175">5. E-Learning PRIVACY POLICY</h5>

						Registration Data and certain other information about you is subject to our Privacy Policy.
                        <br><br>
						<h5 style="color:#003175">6. MEMBER ACCOUNT, PASSWORD AND SECURITY</h5>

						You will have a password and account designation upon completing the Service's registration process. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and account and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account. You agree to (a) immediately notify E-Learning of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. E-Learning cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this Section 6.

						E-Learning accounts may not be shared by more than one person unless express authorization is given by E-Learning Learning, Inc.
                             <br><br>
						<h5 style="color:#003175">7. MEMBER CONDUCT</h5>

						You understand that all information including but not limited to data, text, software, photographs, graphics, illustrations, artwork, video, music, sound, messages, names, logos, trademarks, service marks and other materials ("Content"), whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, are the sole responsibility of the person from which such Content originated. This means that you, and not E-Learning, are entirely responsible for all Content that you upload, post, e-mail, transmit or otherwise make available via the Service. E-Learning does not control the Content posted via the Service and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such Content. Under no circumstances will E-Learning be liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, for any errors or omissions in any Content, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, e-mailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via the Service.

						You understand that the technical processing and transmission of the Service, including your Content, may involve (a) transmissions over various networks; and (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices.
                          <br><br>
						<h5 style="color:#003175">8. SPECIAL ADMONITIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL USE</h5>

						Recognizing the global nature of the Internet, you agree to comply with all local rules regarding online conduct and acceptable Content. Specifically, you agree to comply with all applicable laws regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside.
                            <br><br>
						<h5 style="color:#003175">9. INDEMNITY</h5>

						You agree to indemnify and hold E-Learning, and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, co-branders or other partners, and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of Content you submit, post, transmit or make available through the Service, your use of the Service, your connection to the Service, your violation of the TOS, or your violation of any rights of another.
                          <br><br>
						<h5 style="color:#003175">10. NO RESALE OF SERVICE</h5>

						You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit for any commercial purposes, any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service.
                          <br><br>

						E-Learning reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify or temporarily discontinue the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice. You agree that E-Learning shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or temporary discontinuance of the Service. In the event of permanent discontinuance of the Service, liability is limited to the paid subscription price, pro-rated to the amount of time remaining on the subscription.
                            <br><br>
						<h5 style="color:#003175">12. TERMINATION</h5>

						You agree that E-Learning, in its sole discretion, may terminate your password, account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if E-Learning believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of the TOS. E-Learning may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Service, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Service under any provision of this TOS may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that E-Learning may immediately deactivate or delete your account and all related information and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Service. Further, you agree that E-Learning shall not be liable to you or any third-party for any termination of your access to the Service.
                           <br><br>
						<h5 style="color:#003175">13. LINKS</h5>

						The Service may provide, or third parties may provide, links to other Internet websites or resources. Because E-Learning has no control over such sites and resources, you acknowledge and agree that E-Learning is not responsible for the availability of such external sites or resources, and does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any Content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such sites or resources.

						The TOS constitute the entire agreement between you and E-Learning and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and E-Learning. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate services, third-party content or third-party software.

The failure of E-Learning to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or the TOS must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
